# Repository for Haskell Learning: Theory and Practice

This repository contains my journey into Haskell and functional programming. It includes both practical Haskell code and theoretical exercises on core concepts such as lambda calculus, alpha conversion, beta reduction, and other foundational transformations. Here, I explore the balance between Haskellâ€™s syntax and underlying functional principles, bridging theoretical insights with hands-on coding exercises.
